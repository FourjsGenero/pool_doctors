This application was created by Reuben Barclay at Four Js Asia Pacific and
Blue J Software (www.bluejs.com) in conjunction with FourJs (www.4js.com)
as an example of what can be produced using Genero Mobile.

The Design Brief was ...

Application used by an employee at a remote site

Use small device to record performance of service and/or delivery of goods

The application should be generic and applicable to ...
    Technician – record work performed
    Courier Driver – proof of delivery

Use as many device features as possible
    Camera
    Barcode Reader
    GPS + Map
    Phone/SMS/Email
    Signature Capture
    Database + Synchronization


    
The application is called Pool Doctors as that was an example of a technician/
courier driver role that was a scenario we dreamt up that meet the above 
criteria.  Hopefully after running the app you can visualise that by 
subbing in different data for the customer and product tables, this app could
equally have been called Fridge Doctor, TV Doctor, Car Doctor etc.

The basic business process of the application is
1. customer makes contact with head office and requests work done
2. job is assigned to technician
3. technician uses sync process on device to get jobs allocated to them
4. they use device to make contact with the customer and navigate to the site
5. use device to record the work done
6. use device to record the labour involved
7. use device to document the work done with photos
8. use device to document the work done with notes
9. use device to get the customer to sign off on the work
10. technician uses sync process on device to get jobs back to central server.
